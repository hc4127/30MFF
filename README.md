# Video Project Name
30MFF Video Website

### Project Description
The purpose of the project is to showcase the 30MFF video we made a few weeks ago. The general concept is a site that welcomes freshmen and newcomers to NYUAD, giving them some resources to navigate the campus. The general type of experience and reaction I'm going for was "woah this looks pretty tidy and sleek!"

### Process & Reflection
I mostly based the design of my site on the quick sketch i did for my wireframe. Other than that I just brainstormed on the moment and added whatever I felt like fit the project best. I wanted to use this oppurtunity to practice some css code since I haven't used it in a while. I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't figure out how to implement the interactive map, but I think I should be able to do it once I have more experience with css. I'm pretty familiar with javascript so I'm hoping to use more JavaScript once I familiarize myself with html. I think the project was overall pretty good considering how most of this side of webdev is pretty new to me.
